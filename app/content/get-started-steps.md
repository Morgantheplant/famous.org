1. ##Install the CLI
    <div class="description">
        <p>If you’re an experienced developer who prefers to work with a complete toolchain, we recommend you install Famous using the command line. First, install our CLI: (you’ll need <a href='https://nodejs.org/'>Node.js</a> installed)</p>
        <code class="example"><span>$</span> npm install -g famous-cli</code>
    </div>

2. ##Create a Project
    <div class="description">
        <p>Once you have installed the cli you can easily get started by creating a new project:</p>
        <code class="example"><span>$</span> famous create [name-of-project]</code>
    </div>

3. ##Start up the server
    <div class="description">
        <p>Once you’ve created a new project to your local workstation run the dev command to boot up a development server and install dependencies that have not yet been set up.</p>
        <code class="example"><span>$</span> famous dev</code>
    </div>

4. ##Open the project
    <div class="description">
        <p>Then open up the project’s <code>src/</code> folder, where you’ll ﬁnd the beginnings of some simple application code. As you make changes there, your application will reload live in your browser at <a href='http://localhost:1337/'>localhost:1337</a></p>
    </div>

5. ##Deploy to the cloud
    <div class="description">
        <p>When you are ready to share with the world run the deploy command to upload your code to the famous CDN. You will receive both a direct link to your project and an embed code to include it in other projects.</p>
        <code class="example"><span>$</span> famous deploy</code>
    </div>
